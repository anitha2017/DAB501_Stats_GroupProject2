    "This project analysis data on COVID-19 Test Results by Date of Specimen Collection (By County) for the state of Connecticut in the United States. Within data set we were able to review the relationship between the number of test issues and the number of test that returned positive. This gave us the ability to apply statistical models and predict the probability. \n",

We needed to write a formula that extracted the DAY | MONTH | YEAR values from the exisiting data field and then concatinate them into a useful date field. We additionally choose to keep the individual DAY | MONTH | YEAR columns as they would assist us with additional sorting in python. \n",
