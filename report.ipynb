    "## Introduction\n",
    "This project analysis data on COVID-19 Test Results by Date of Specimen Collection (By County) for the state of Connecticut in the United States. Within data set we were able to review the relationship between the number of test issues and the number of test that returned positive. This gave us the ability to apply statistical models and predict the probability. \n",

From this excercise we recongnized the mean of Connecticut was 129.50924657534247. There were major differences between each of the counties as a result of population density. \n",
    " - Fairfield had a mean of 277.8383561643836 with a population of approximately 62,000.\n",
    " - New Haven had a mean of 276.786301369863 with a population of approximately 135,000.\n",
    " - Hartford has a mean of 250.9041095890411 with a population of approximately 120,000.\n",
    " - Tolland had the lowest mean of 29.221917808219178 with an approximate population of 149,000.\n",
